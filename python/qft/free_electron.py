#What is the best way to implement the free electron gas.
# given perturbing potential f(t)V, give wavefunction at all times.
# as function of N and L
#We have to avoid this somehow. The wavefunction is too big.
# independantly do N iniitial value problems. Are there savings to do 2 than 2x1?
def psi(x):  #x is an N long vector
    return det e^ikx

def psidagpsi:(x1,x2): # both are N long vectors.

# for certain operators, the marginalization vastly reduces
def rho(x1,x2):


# could impleent an iterative scheme.
