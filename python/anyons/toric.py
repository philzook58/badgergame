# since I can't specify the ground state in terms of classical configuraitons
# One approach is to use the basis of particle states?
# scpeify locations of failure of trvalty of flux and charge
# In other words, two fields.
# Will this get me everywhere? Fill up the whole space?

# 2^(2N) calssical confugration N being number of vertices. (edges are twice that)
# roughly 2^N different configs for flux and 2^N for charge
# the counting is roughly right. Minus that full torus loops. And Minus that we can only have even # of quasiparticles

# maybe because they have to come in pairs its an overspecification.

#Or we could maintain a list of abstract ops we've applied to ground state.
# and come up with some equivlaence rules for compression

#Where are we going with this? What can computer do?
#could find matrix elements in subspaces. then solve those with scipy.

#So toric code uses particle basis.
#It seems infeasible to use classical configurations
